# ⚗️ Week 2 — Materials Datasets and Data Representation

**📅 Duration:** Oct 8 → Oct 15, 2025  
**🎯 Focus:** Understanding material datasets, descriptors, and data preparation for ML

---

## ✅ Highlights of the Week
- Completed half of Week 2 curriculum (MIT OCW + data practice)  
- Learned how materials properties are represented numerically  
- Explored datasets using `Matminer` and `Materials Project API`  
- Practiced cleaning and visualizing data in Colab  
- Added commits for updated notebooks to GitHub
