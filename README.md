# ðŸ§ª Materials Informatics Portfolio

This repository documents my learning and projects as I explore **Materials Informatics** â€” combining **materials chemistry**, **computational modeling**, and **machine learning**.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
The portfolio covers:
1. Data exploration using `matminer` and `pandas`
2. Analysis of computational datasets (e.g., bandgap, formation energy)
3. Machine Learning models for materials property prediction
4. A final capstone project integrating physics-based and AI-driven insights

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- Matminer (materials datasets & features)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Optional: Qiskit (quantum chemistry), Tableau (for dashboards)

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Build real-world materials datasets
- Train and evaluate ML models on physical properties
- Understand the connection between quantum chemistry and materials AI
